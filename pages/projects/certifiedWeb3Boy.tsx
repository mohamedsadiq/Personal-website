                            The Certified Web3 Boy (CWB) project is a creative endeavor inspired by the innovative spirit of Developer Dao and the cultural impact of the Certified Lover Boy album. As a passionate fan of Web3 technology and the CLB album, I found immense joy in bringing this project to life. The fusion of cutting-edge blockchain concepts with pop culture has made this journey both challenging and rewarding.

                            I'm excited to share the results of my work with the community. <br/>  <br/>You can explore the live website <a className="text-[#000] underline" href='https://replit.com/@mohamedsadiq/cwb' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> to see the CWB NFTs in action. For those interested in the technical aspects, the frontend code is available <a className="text-[#000] underline" href='https://github.com/mohamedsadiq/cwb_front_end' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and you can review the smart contract <a className="text-[#000] underline" href='https://github.com/mohamedsadiq/cwb-nfts_smart_contract' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

The existing website did not represent the DAO, the design was so simple, and it did not deliver what it should have been delivering, first step was to analyze the flow and overall aesthetic appeal of the website and figure out the direction that we should take. After that, my job was to simplify the process as much as possible and make it intuitive for the users, as well as improve the visual appeal of the entire site"
