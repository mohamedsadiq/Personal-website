    myContributionsPara:"I was the champion of the project on the design side. The existing website did not represent the DAO, the design was so simple, and it did not deliver what it should have been delivering, first step was to analyze the flow and overall aesthetic appeal of the website and figure out the direction that we should take. After that, my job was to simplify the process as much as possible and make it intuitive for the users, as well as improve the visual appeal of the entire site"
