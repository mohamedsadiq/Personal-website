              When I initially joined DeveloperDAO, my excitement to contribute
              to the DAO's projects was palpable. One standout project that
              captured my interest was the inception of DeveloperDAO Fm. This
              website aimed to provide coders with an enriched experience,
              allowing them to code while enjoying the soothing accompaniment of
              Lo-Fi music. <br /> <br />
              Beyond its musical offerings, the platform boasted a Pomodoro
              technique-based timer and a seamless channel-switching feature,
              enhancing the coding environment.
            </p>
            <h2>My Contributions</h2>
            <p>
              Delving into my role within this project, I eagerly embraced the
              opportunity to craft an immersive user experience. The heart of
              the experience was encapsulated in the ingeniously simple yet
              functionally profound logo of DeveloperDAO. To infuse an emotional
              incentive.
            </p>

              src={img0}

              objectFit="cover"
              // layout="fill"
              objectPosition="center"
              placeholder="blur"
              quality={100}
              className="rounded-xl block mt-4"
            />

            <span className="project_img_des">
              (These were the first attempts to discover the logo's potential, I
              shared this design on <a target="_blank" href="">my X account.</a>){" "}
            </span>
            <p>
              I designed the logo's interactions. A noteworthy feature was the
              logo's dynamic response to user actions â€“ clicking the play
              button prompted the logo's face to break into a cheerful smile,
              while pausing the music led to the logo's smile fading away. This
              nuanced interaction was poised to delight users and accentuate
              their engagement.
