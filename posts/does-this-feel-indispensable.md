From the first stone tools to today’s AI, humanity’s relationship with technology has always blended utility and experience. Early hand axes weren’t just functional—they were shaped for grip, hinting at a primal urge for tools to feel right. Fast-forward and here we are in the AI era: while raw functionality (e.g., code generation, data analysis) remains critical, it’s increasingly commoditized. AI models and their infrastructure let competitors replicate features easily. A startup could clone 60% of ChatGPT’s functionality in weeks.

This forces a shift in strategy. To stand out, products must excel at how they solve problems, not just that it solve them. I’m talking about seamless integration into workflows, reducing user friction. invoke certain types of emotion, creating layers over layers of rich and nuanced user experiences. Competitors can mimic features, but replicating the experience—intuitive adaptation, contextual awareness—requires deeper insight into human behavior.

Peter Thiel’s “zero to one” mantra—creating monopolies through novelty—still applies but with a twist. In the AI era, true uniqueness lives at the intersection of functionality and experiential depth.

Functionality matters—no one tolerates a stylish but broken tool. Yet in the AI age, the bar for “good enough” is lower than ever. The lasting value comes from designing systems that reshape how we live, not just what we do. The question isn’t “Does this work?” but “Does this feel indispensable?
