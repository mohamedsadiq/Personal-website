A month ago, I started the project "Building On Imagination”, exploring the process of turning ideas into tangible products. Now, I want to share my latest venture, DAOs Spot. This project focuses on DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and provides users with a platform to discover, learn about, and search for various DAOs. Additionally, it includes a job board for web3 jobs. In this blog post, I will discuss the challenges I encountered during the development of DAOs Spot and how I grappled with my designer side.

During the development of DAOs Spot, one of the challenges I faced was the dilemma of sharing imperfect work. As a product designer, I have always strived for perfection before sharing my work. However, the iterative nature of the development process made it difficult to achieve that level of perfection. I learned that sharing progress, even if it's not flawless, fosters transparency and valuable feedback from users. It allowed me to make necessary adjustments and continuously improve the platform.

Looking ahead, my plan for DAOs Spot involves focusing on SEO, content expansion, and user engagement. Optimizing the website for search engines will increase its visibility and attract a wider audience. Expanding the content on the platform will provide users with a comprehensive resource on DAOs, including educational articles, case studies, and maybe interviews with industry experts. To ensure that the platform truly meets the needs of users, I’m thinking of offering tools for the DAOs as well.

Throughout this journey, I have reflected on the aspects of myself that needed to evolve. Embracing imperfections and stepping out of my comfort zone was essential for growth. I have learned that shedding old notions and embracing new perspectives is crucial in adapting to a dynamic environment.

Building DAOs Spot has been a challenging yet rewarding experience. Overcoming the struggles as a product designer and embracing imperfections has taught me resilience and adaptability. With my plans for SEO, content expansion, and user engagement, I aim to create a platform that educates, connects, and contributes to the growth of DAOs.
