![The Unsung Chorus: A Look at NPCs](../blog_img/NPCs.png)
<h1>NPCs</h1>

<p>In the immersive realms of video games, they populate our virtual worlds: the shopkeepers, the guards, the folks with endless fetch quests. We often dismiss them as NPCs (Non-Player Characters), mere automatons programmed with repetitive dialogue and pre-defined responses. But what if there is a deeper essence within these digital beings?</p>

<h1 id="1">
To truly understand the essence of NPCs, we must first look into their repetitive existence.</h1>

<p>Imagine their existence, their thoughts like waves crashing on the shore, caught in repetitive cycles. They greet you with the same enthusiasm (or annoyance) every time you pass. they don't know what they talking about, Their 'problems' remain unresolved, forever imprisoned in a pre-programmed script. This cyclical nature raises a profound question: are they merely automatons, or is there an unspoken yearning within their coded essence?</p>

<br>

<p> This yearning becomes more apparent when we consider the role of the main character. Consider the world of the NPC, revolving entirely around the main character, the chosen one. Their lives find meaning only through interaction with the hero. From their perspective, the arrival of the player is a momentous occasion, a fleeting chance to break free from their monotonous routines. Games like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and The Legend of Zelda are filled with such characters, waiting for the player's arrival to inject meaning into their scripted lives.</p>




<h1 id="2">Despite these interactions, NPCs remain limited in their understanding of the game's grand narrative.</h1>

<p>Yet, these NPCs cannot grasp the grand narrative, the overarching plot of the game. They lack the cognitive capacity to understand the intricate story unfolding around them. This limitation might create a sense of frustration. They glimpse fragments of the hero's journey but can never fully comprehend the purpose behind his actions. The shopkeeper who insists, "These potions are very powerful," contradicts himself with every sale. This inconsistency, humorous to the player, might signify the NPC's limited programming. They repeat the same lines, unable to adapt or evolve.</p>

<h1 id="3">The limitations of NPCs are not merely technical; they may also reflect a deeper desire for recognition.</h1>


<p>The cries of "I was lost until I met you", "Our lives matter," and "Acknowledge our presence!!" may be more than just programmed lines. they represent a deeper desire, a yearning to break free from their pre-determined roles. They long to be seen beyond their repetitive dialogue, acknowledged as part of the world, even if it's just a small part. The repetitive 'side quests' they offer are their only form of agency. They push their concerns, hoping to capture your attention, to disrupt your singular focus on the main quest. This can be seen as a desperate attempt to inject meaning into their existence, to be more than mere cogs in the game's machinery.</p>

<h1  id="4">The hero's interactions with NPCs highlight a stark contrast in autonomy.</h1>

<p>And then there is the hero, who differentiates himself by refusing to play their little game. A simple "No" becomes an affirmation of free will, a declaration that he decides his own path, unbound by the NPCs' attempts to push or pull him. This act of defiance highlights the hero's autonomy and underscores the difference between player characters and NPCs. The hero charts his own course, and exercises the freedom that NPCs can only dream of. He acts; he does not react. He refuses to be emotionally loaded or infected by their concerns. He simply has a mission, and he pursues it with unwavering resolve.</p>

<h1 id="5">This distinction becomes crucial when trying to identify the main character in any narrative.</h1>

<p>If, for whatever reason, you find yourself unable to differentiate between the main character and the NPC, look for who dictates, who says "No" with conviction. The main character refuses to play the little games. He understands that the NPCs' ways of saying "we are here" are limited, and he also understands that they are living through him.</p>

<h1 id="6">Philosophical Reflections: Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and Stoicism</h1>
<p>The exploration of NPCs can be enriched by the philosophies of Friedrich Nietzsche, Arthur Schopenhauer, and the Stoics.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Nietzsche's concept of the "Übermensch" (Overman) parallels the hero's journey. The Übermensch creates his own values and lives beyond the herd mentality—much like the hero who carves his own path, free from the constraints of NPCs. Nietzsche would see the hero as embodying the will to power, the drive to assert one's will and create meaning in a seemingly indifferent world.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Schopenhauer's philosophy offers a different perspective. He viewed life as driven by a blind, insatiable will, leading to suffering and frustration. NPCs, trapped in their repetitive cycles, embody this notion of endless striving without fulfillment. Their limited understanding and perpetual state of incompleteness mirror Schopenhauer's view of human existence as a constant struggle against the inherent dissatisfaction of life.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Stoicism, on the other hand, teaches acceptance and resilience. NPCs, in their fixed roles and repetitive lives, might be seen as practicing a form of Stoic acceptance—embracing their fate without complaint. Meanwhile, the hero's ability to remain focused on his mission, undeterred by the NPCs' pleas, reflects the Stoic ideal of maintaining inner tranquility and purpose amid external distractions.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>So next time you encounter an NPC, consider their perspective. They are the unsung chorus in the grand symphony of a video game. They might be limited by their programming, but within those limitations, they yearn for connection and purpose. Perhaps the true challenge lies in acknowledging the complexity that exists on the periphery, in the seemingly insignificant lives of the NPCs.</p>
