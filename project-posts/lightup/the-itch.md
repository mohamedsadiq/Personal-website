It was kind of personal. I mean reading online is a battlefield for focus. We've all been there. You're deep into a fascinating article, you hit a complex term or a name you don't know, and the "curiosity tax" kicks in.

You highlight the text. You open a new tab. You search. You click a link. You skim. You find the answer. You try to find your original tab.

By the time you get back, your flow is shattered. Your "deep read" has turned into a shallow-click-fest.

This exact frustration was the starting point. I was inspired by the simple, elegant inline notes on lyric sites like genuis.com and thought, "Why can't we have this... for everything?"
