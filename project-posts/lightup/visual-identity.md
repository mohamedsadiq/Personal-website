When I started shaping LightUp's identity, I wanted the branding to feel as soft and luminous as the idea itself. The logo began as a simple spark—literally a glowing dot expanding into light. I refined it into a geometric form that suggests illumination and focus, built on minimal contrast between dark and light modes. The wordmark uses a clean sans-serif typeface to echo the extension's clarity and precision.

The color palette balances calm neutrality with subtle energy: pale ivory for light, deep slate for night, and a single accent hue—a warm yellow—to represent the moment of understanding. Every design choice reinforces the product's philosophy: minimal intervention, maximum clarity.

The branding extended naturally into the product site and visuals. I used soft gradients and quiet motion to suggest illumination without distraction, aiming for a calm aesthetic that mirrors the reading experience LightUp provides.
