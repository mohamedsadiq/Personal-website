LightUp didn’t start with a name—it started with a feeling. I wanted the extension to read like a friend leaning over your shoulder, illuminating a dense paragraph without yanking you out of your flow. The word “LightUp” captured that exact action: a quiet spark that makes meaning visible. Once the name clicked, I traced it back to the rest of the identity so every touchpoint felt cohesive.

I mapped three guardrails for the brand:
- **Gentle clarity:** the UI should hover, not shout. I leaned on rounded geometry and generous breathing room to keep interactions soft.
- **Spark-first cues:** the mark needed to work at 16px inside a toolbar yet scale to hero images. The final glyph is a simple node bursting upward—a tiny ignition moment.
- **Calm luminosity:** a restrained palette of warm ivory, graphite, and a single glow-yellow ensures the extension feels credible on academic sites while still carrying its own personality.

With those inputs, I iterated on logomarks, typographic stacks, and poster-style assets simultaneously. Seeing the name rendered next to the glyph helped me keep curves, counters, and rhythm aligned. The brand system now extends from install cards to launch posters without losing that quiet spark energy.
