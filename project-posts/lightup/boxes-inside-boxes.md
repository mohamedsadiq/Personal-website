Knowledge is not a flat surface but a dynamic structure—boxes within boxes, each containing layers of meaning waiting to be unpacked. Every concept holds the potential to expand, revealing deeper connections and insights. I was obsessed with this concept for a period of time; this phrase kept the fire of the idea alive in my mind. It satisfied my intellectual curiosity and pushed me to explore the idea further. The question became: how can this way of thinking live on a page? 

LightUp was my answer. Highlight a sentence, and a small window opens—a box that unveils hidden depths. From there, new dimensions of understanding unfold, allowing you to explore ideas without losing your place.

By keeping this exploration within the bounds of the same page, LightUp creates a dynamic representation of how knowledge grows: contained yet infinite, simple yet profound.
