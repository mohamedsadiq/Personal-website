Designing LightUp’s interaction layer felt like choreographing a dance between the text you’re reading and the tiny helper living on top of it. The UI needed to appear instantly, explain itself without a tutorial, and disappear the moment you wanted to focus again. Every micro-interaction was tuned to keep readers in their flow.

### Principles that guided the motion system
- **Surface only what’s needed:** toolbars stay compact until a highlight is detected; context-specific actions fade in only when relevant.
- **Motion as feedback, not decoration:** popups scale from the selection anchor and settle with a 120/20 spring so you always know where they came from.
- **Respect the page:** all panels inherit the site’s light/dark theme and avoid blocking underlying content.

### Interaction moments worth calling out
1. Selecting text reveals a pill-shaped toolbar that invites a single tap to explain or summarize. The buttons pulse lightly on hover to signal readiness without screaming for attention.
2. Opening the Ask Anything panel slides in a focused column that remembers your last query. It supports keyboard navigation, making it fast to follow up or retry.
3. Inline summaries expand in place, pushing content gently rather than overlaying it. When you dismiss them, the page springs back with zero scroll jolts.

The videos in this section capture those small gestures: the way the toolbar hugs highlighted text, how the popup breathes as it loads, and how dark mode keeps the glow subtle. Together they make LightUp feel alive without ever feeling loud.
